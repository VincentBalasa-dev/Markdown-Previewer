# 📝 Markdown Previewer

A lightweight **React.js** Markdown editor that displays a live preview of formatted text as you type.  
This project was built using **CodePen** for convenience, so all components are contained in one file rather than modularized.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This project focuses on practicing **React hooks**, **real-time rendering**, and **Markdown parsing** using the `marked` library.  
It provides a clean split-screen interface for editing and previewing simultaneously.

## ⚙️ Features
- Real-time Markdown-to-HTML conversion  
- Split-screen editor and preview panels  
- Default placeholder text with Markdown examples  
- Clean, responsive layout using **Bootstrap 5**  
- Font Awesome icons for polished UI

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- Controlled `<textarea>` inputs  
- Using `marked.parse()` for safe Markdown rendering  
- Conditional rendering with placeholders

> This project was written in a single file for simplicity within CodePen.  
> For larger-scale applications, each component would typically be split into its own file under a modular structure.
